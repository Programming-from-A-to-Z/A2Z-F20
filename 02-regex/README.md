### JavaScript Regex functions

- JavaScript Regex reference: [`test()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test), [`exec()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec)
- String: [`match()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match)
- Splitting with regex: [`split()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
- Replace with regex: [`replace()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace)

## Assignment

Design an exercise around regular expressions. Here are some ideas if you are feeling stuck! (To be clear, just do **one** thing, and writing code is not required for this assignment!)

### Regular Expressions Experiments

- Experiment with using Regular Expressions in a text editor. What new powers does this unlock in your workflow? Write up a post documenting your experiments.
- Play an online Regular Expressions game. Write up a post documenting your experience. Here are two that I found, share others!

### Regular Expressions in JavaScript

- Chop up a text into words using `split()` and rebuild the text as separate `<span>` elements that you can interact with individually. [Here is example code](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/Jr3zCQw-9) from [this video](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/038-word-interactor.html).
- Create a programmatic version of the algorithm you developed for [the constrained writing exercise](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18-eQtpSXKcMdvFuk9ub1yjY-2zW5T067R0o34BT9BTM/edit?usp=sharing).
- The [Flesch Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) is a "reading level" score for a passage in English. Here is a [p5 sketch that calculate the Flesch Index](https://editor.p5js.org/a2zitp/sketches/OQx3A3Sa0) for a body of text. How could this be improved / changed with regular expressions?
- Create a mad libs generator. For reference [here is a video about making Mad Libs with p5.js](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/039-madlibs.html)!
- Create a "word replacer" (all words that start with E to words that start with A, all fruits with vegetables, etc.)

## Data and APIs

In preparation for next week, add a link to a data source or API (even just data that appears in raw form on a web page) that interests you! Don't worry about this too much, anything will do! I'll use this list to prepare examples for next week.

- add a link to your API / data source here
- [NYC Open Data: Public Recycling Bins](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/sxx4-xhzg.json)
- [Leaflet API: an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html)
- [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech)
